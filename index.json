A multitude of microtasks vie for user attention to crowdsource information, perform momentary assessments, personalize services, and execute actions with a single touch.

Prior works have exploited contextual cues and behavioral data to identify interruptibility for microtasks with much success. With Quick Question, we explore use of reinforcement learning (RL) to schedule microtasks while minimizing user annoyance and compare its performance with supervised learning. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and use Advantage Actor Critic algorithm to identify interruptible moments based on context and history of user interactions. In our 5-week, 30-participant study, we compare the proposed RL algorithm against supervised learning methods. While the mean number of responses between both methods is commensurate, RL is more effective at avoiding dismissal of notifications and improves user experience over time.","tags":["\"Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence\"","\"Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction\"","\"Computer Science - Machine Learning\""],"title":"Quick Question: Interrupting Users for Microtasks with Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mehmet Koseoglu","Ayca Ozcelikkale"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611673272,"objectID":"665a304baef0d24922eee864d140bfd4","permalink":"/publication/koseoglu-how-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-26T15:01:11.664781Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koseoglu-how-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a self-tuning RL agent that learns to adjust the accuracy of the samples when the observation cost is an intrinsic part of the environment.","tags":[],"title":"How to miss data?

The discontent is exacerbated by the large number of applications that target limited user attention.

In these unattended missions, AUVs are typically sent by a central node, such as a submarine, and they move autonomously. Although there is no need for continuous monitoring of AUV nodes, the central node may occasionally need to broadcast a message to all nodes in the fleet to announce any mission change, such as re-routing or ordering them to return back to the base. However, maximum duration of the mission depends on the lifetime of the AUV network, which is limited by the size and capacity of on-board batteries. This necessitates the detailed analysis of energy consumption characteristics and lifetime constraints in order to avoid operational failure. Here we study the connectivity properties of an energy-constrained ad-hoc AUV network through broadcast simulations.

In addition, underwater acoustic networks show unique transmission characteristics such as frequency-dependent attenuation, which causes the transmission power to significantly depend on the bandwidth and the distance. We here investigate the cross-layer energy minimization problem in underwater ALOHA networks considering the unique transmission properties of the underwater medium. We first analyze the separate optimization of the physical (PHY) and multiple access control (MAC) layers to minimize energy consumption. We analytically obtain the energy-optimum channel access rate for the ALOHA MAC layer, which minimizes the energy consumption per successfully transmitted bit. We then formulate a cross-layer optimization problem, which jointly optimizes PHY and MAC layers to minimize energy consumption. We show that such cross-layer optimization reduces the energy consumption per bit as much as 66% in comparison with separate optimization of both layers. Cross-layer optimization achieves this energy efficiency by assigning higher MAC-layer resources to the nodes that have a longer distance to the base station, i.e., which experience a less efficient PHY layer. Moreover, cross-layer optimization significantly increases the amount data transferred until first node failure since it results in a more homogeneous energy consumption distribution among the nodes.","tags":["\"telecommunication power management\"","\"energy conservation\"","\"energy efficiency\"","\"Joints\"","\"Protocols\"","\"access protocols\"","\"ALOHA\"","\"ALOHA MAC layer\"","\"Base stations\"","\"cross-layer design\"","\"cross-layer energy minimization\"","\"cross-layer optimization problem\"","\"Energy consumption\"","\"energy-optimum channel access rate\"","\"frequency-dependent attenuation\"","\"homogeneous energy consumption distribution\"","\"Minimization\"","\"multiple access control (MAC)\"","\"multiple access control layers\"","\"Optimization\"","\"power consumption\"","\"Propagation delay\"","\"transmission properties\"","\"underwater acoustic communication\"","\"underwater acoustic networks\"","\"underwater ALOHA networks\"","\"underwater medium\"","\"underwater networks\"","\"underwater node recharging\""],"title":"Cross-Layer Energy Minimization for Underwater ALOHA Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Here we present the delay and capacity analysis of two low-overhead access protocols in a setting similar to LTEM which is recently standardized for IoT communications. The first protocol that we evaluate is an ALOHA-like immediate transmission scheme where the data is transmitted without channel reservation. The second protocol is a preamble-initiated contention-based access scheme where a frequency/time resource is imperfectly reserved by the transmission of a random preamble. Our results show that preamble-initiated contention-based access improves small message throughput 86% both with respect to the ALOHA-like scheme and the conventional LTE channel access. On the other hand, the ALOHA-like scheme provides 62% lower delay in comparison to the preamble-initiated contention based scheme at low traffic load conditions. Conventional LTE channel access does not provide any improvement in throughput or delay over these two schemes for small message transmissions.","tags":["\"5G mobile communication\"","\"cellular M2M communications\"","\"cellular radio\"","\"channel access procedures\"","\"Cobalt\"","\"Data communication\"","\"Delays\"","\"frequency-time resource\"","\"Internet of Things\"","\"IoT communications\"","\"IoT devices\"","\"Long Term Evolution\"","\"low traffic load conditions\"","\"LTE channel access\"","\"Machine-to-machine communications\"","\"message transmissions\"","\"Multiaccess communication\"","\"next-generation wireless communications\"","\"preamble initiated contention\"","\"protocol\"","\"protocols\"","\"Protocols\"","\"small data transmission schemes\"","\"state-of-the-art cellular standards\"","\"telecommunication traffic\"","\"Throughput\"","\"wireless channels\""],"title":"Performance analysis of small data transmission schemes for cellular M2M communications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

This problem has been receiving significant interest from the research community in the context of the LTE-A random access channel. Most studies, however, consider load control schemes with few fixed service classes, which can provide limited service differentiation. We propose an alternative scheme where the load is controlled by the price announced by the base station. The proposed method controls the load effectively and provides negligible delay for messages with the highest priority. It also enables low-cost wireless access to delay-tolerant messages by generating most of the revenue from high-priority messages. We derive pricing-based load control schemes for throughput and revenue maximization, and present the relationship between delay, revenue, and cost in both schemes.

A serious issue is that massive M2M arrivals can overload the LTE-A random access channel, resulting in a significant access delay. There have been a number of proposals to control this overload; however, there are no studies on the mathematical characterization of delay bounds to the best of our knowledge. Here, we derive lower bounds for the LTE-A average random access delay for both a regular traffic pattern (uniformly distributed arrivals) and for a traffic pattern, indicating a serious congestion (beta-distributed arrivals). The proposed delay bounds, which predict the minimum delay with less than 6% error, present the fundamental limits of delay that can be achieved by a practical load-balancing algorithm. This paper is also one of the first attempts toward the mathematical analysis of beta-distributed arrivals. We also analyze the effect of estimation accuracy, frequency of random access opportunities, and the number of preambles on the access delay. We show that it is possible to reduce the access delay by several orders of magnitude using an appropriate configuration of these system parameters.","tags":["\"Long Term Evolution\"","\"Delays\"","\"3GPP\"","\"4G mobile communication\"","\"machine-to-machine communications\"","\"Machine-to-machine communications\"","\"Radio access networks\"","\"Estimation\"","\"Base stations\"","\"Load flow control\"","\"Multiaccess communication\"","\"Proposals\"","\"beta-distributed arrivals\"","\"Long Term Evolution-advanced performance\"","\"LTE-A average random access delay\"","\"massive M2M arrivals\"","\"mathematical analysis\"","\"practical load-balancing algorithm\"","\"regular traffic pattern\""],"title":"Lower Bounds on the LTE-A Average Random Access Delay Under Massive M2M Arrivals","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Although most M2M devices infrequently connect to the network and transmit small messages, a serious congestion may occur during the initial channel access phase if a massive number of devices activate near-simultaneously. To address this issue, previous studies have proposed load control methods based on broadcasting an access probability to all nodes or groups of nodes at times of congestion. Such approaches, however, are inadequate in satisfying the wide range of service requirements of IoT applications. Here we propose a pricing-based load control and service differentiation method for M2M traffic over LTE-A which is based on charging M2M devices for each successful channel access and subsequent short message transmission. By increasing the price during congestion, the proposed method effectively controls the access load. It also operates as a service differentiation mechanism providing delay-sensitive nodes a shorter access delay and charging higher prices from them. Simulation results show that the delay performance of the proposed method is close to an optimum load controller; and, it provides service differentiation unlike previous load-control approaches.","tags":["\"access probability\"","\"Base stations\"","\"channel access phase\"","\"Channel estimation\"","\"delay-sensitive nodes\"","\"Delays\"","\"human-generated traffic\"","\"Internet of Things\"","\"Internet of Things market\"","\"IoT market\"","\"load control methods\"","\"Load flow control\"","\"Long Term Evolution\"","\"LTE-A\"","\"LTE-A standard\"","\"LTE-Advanced standard\"","\"M2M communications\"","\"M2M devices\"","\"machine-to-machine\"","\"machine-to-machine communications\"","\"Optimized production technology\"","\"optimum load controller\"","\"Performance evaluation\"","\"pricing\"","\"Pricing\"","\"pricing-based load control\"","\"service differentiation method\"","\"service requirements\"","\"short message transmission\"","\"telecommunication congestion control\"","\"telecommunication services\""],"title":"Smart pricing for service differentiation and load control of the LTE-A IoT system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We first model a single-hop network, and then a multi-hop network. We show that operating the CSMA network at a high throughput is energy inefficient since unsuccessful carrier sensing attempts increase the energy consumption per transmitted bit. Operating the network at a low throughput also causes energy inefficiency because of increased sleeping duration. Achieving a balance between these two opposite operating regimes, we derive the energy-optimum carrier-sensing rate and the energy-optimum throughput which maximize the number of transmitted bits for a given energy budget. For the single-hop case, we show that the energy-optimum total throughput increases as the number of nodes sharing the channel increases. For the multi-hop case, we show that energy-optimum throughput decreases as the degree of the conflict graph corresponding to the network increases. For both cases, the energy-optimum throughput reduces as the power required for carrier-sensing increases. The energy-optimum throughput is also shown to be substantially lower than the maximum throughput and the gap increases as the degree of the conflict graph increases for multi-hop networks.","tags":["\"telecommunication power management\"","\"energy efficiency\"","\"Throughput\"","\"Markov processes\"","\"carrier sense multiple access\"","\"Energy consumption\"","\"Multiaccess communication\"","\"Access schemes\"","\"analytical models\"","\"Carrier sense multiple access\"","\"carrier sensing rate\"","\"conflict graph\"","\"CSMA based wireless networks\"","\"energy budget\"","\"energy optimum throughput\"","\"graph theory\"","\"multihop network\"","\"performance analysis\"","\"radio networks\"","\"Sensors\"","\"single hop network\"","\"Spread spectrum communication\"","\"throughput\"","\"transmitted bit maximization\"","\"Wireless communication\""],"title":"Energy-Optimum Throughput and Carrier Sensing Rate in CSMA-Based Wireless Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We propose a semi-Markov model for the 2-node CSMA channel. For the 2-node case, the capacity reduces to 40% of the zero-delay capacity when the one-way propagation delay is 10% of the packet transmission time. We then extend this model and obtain the optimum symmetric probing rate that achieves the maximum network throughput as a function of the average propagation delay, d̅, and the number of nodes sharing the channel, N. The proposed model predicts that the total capacity decreases with d̅-1 as N goes to infinity when all nodes probe the channel at the optimum rate. The optimum probing rate for each node decreases with 1/N and the total optimum probing rate decreases faster than d̅-1 as N goes to infinity. We investigate how the short-term unfairness problem in CSMA worsens as the propagation delay increases and propose a back-off mechanism to mitigate this issue. The theoretical results presented in this paper can be used as a benchmark for the performance improvements provided by algorithms that have already been developed.","tags":["\"Throughput\"","\"Markov processes\"","\"carrier sense multiple access\"","\"Protocols\"","\"Propagation delay\"","\"Multiaccess communication\"","\"packet transmission time\"","\"backoff mechanism\"","\"Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)\"","\"channel capacity\"","\"Collision avoidance\"","\"CSMA channel capacity\"","\"CSMA protocol\"","\"delays\"","\"IEEE 802.11 Standards\"","\"large propagation delay\"","\"multiaccess communication\"","\"network throughput modeling\"","\"nonnegligible propagation delay\"","\"optimum probing rate\"","\"optimum symmetric probing rate\"","\"packet radio networks\"","\"semiMarkov model\"","\"short-term unfairness problem\"","\"Wireless networks\"","\"zero delay capacity\""],"title":"Throughput Modeling of Single Hop CSMA Networks with Non-Negligible Propagation Delay","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mehmet Koseoglu","Ezhan Karasan","Murat Alanyali"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611673270,"objectID":"4e041709ef64a5965ad9f98f4a33d0e5","permalink":"/publication/koseoglu-effect-2012/","publishdate":"2021-01-26T15:01:10.213286Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koseoglu-effect-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"As the penetration of wireless networks increase, number of neighboring networks contending for the limited unlicensed spectrum band increases. This interference between neighboring networks leads to large systems of locally interacting networks. We investigate whether the short-term fairness of this system of networks degrades with the system size and density if transmitters employ random spectrum access with carrier sensing (CSMA). Our results suggest that (a) short-term fair capacity, which is the throughput region that can be achieved within the acceptable limits of short-term fairness, reduces as the number of contending neighboring networks, i.e., degree of the conflict graph, increases for random regular conflict graphs where each vertex has the same number of neighbors, (b) short-term fair capacity weakly depends on the network size for a random regular conflict graph but a stronger dependence is observed for a grid deployment. We demonstrate the implications of this study on a city-wide Wi-Fi network deployment scenario by relating the short-term fairness to the density of deployment. We also present related results from the statistical physics literature on long-range correlations in large systems and point out the relation between these results and short-term fairness of CSMA systems.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of network density and size on the short-term fairness performance of CSMA systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mehmet Koseoglu","Ezhan Karasan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1270080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611673271,"objectID":"2d15d689471fb4346994808e0105e705","permalink":"/publication/koseoglu-joint-2010/","publishdate":"2021-01-26T15:01:10.744981Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koseoglu-joint-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Optical burst switching (OBS) is a promising technology for optical grids with short-lived and interactive data communication requirements.
