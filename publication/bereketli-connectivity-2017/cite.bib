 abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) networks play a crucial role in tactical, commercial, and scientific applications, where reliable and robust communication protocols are needed due to the challenging characteristics of the channel. With this motivation, connectivity of AUV networks in different regions with varying transducer characteristics are analyzed through simulations based on real-life orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based communication experiments over noisy and Doppler-distorted channels. Doppler compensation is performed according to the autocorrelation using the cyclic prefix. Using binary and quadrature phase shift keying (BPSK and QPSK) modulation schemes in conjunction with low density parity check (LDPC) coding, error rate levels are investigated through shallow water pond and at-sea experiments. It is shown that, the utilized transmission scheme is capable of correcting all bit errors among nearly one million bits transmitted up to a distance of 1 km, yielding a payload rate of 15.6 kbps with 4096 subcarriers and QPSK modulation. The simulations provide key parameters that must be taken into account in the design of scalable and connected AUV networks.},
