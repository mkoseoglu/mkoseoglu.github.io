 abstract = {As the penetration of wireless networks increase, number of neighboring networks contending for the limited unlicensed spectrum band increases. This interference between neighboring networks leads to large systems of locally interacting networks. We investigate whether the short-term fairness of this system of networks degrades with the system size and density if transmitters employ random spectrum access with carrier sensing (CSMA). Our results suggest that (a) short-term fair capacity, which is the throughput region that can be achieved within the acceptable limits of short-term fairness, reduces as the number of contending neighboring networks, i.e., degree of the conflict graph, increases for random regular conflict graphs where each vertex has the same number of neighbors, (b) short-term fair capacity weakly depends on the network size for a random regular conflict graph but a stronger dependence is observed for a grid deployment. We demonstrate the implications of this study on a city-wide Wi-Fi network deployment scenario by relating the short-term fairness to the density of deployment. We also present related results from the statistical physics literature on long-range correlations in large systems and point out the relation between these results and short-term fairness of CSMA systems.},
