 abstract = {In this paper, we first propose a joint resource and path selection algorithm for optical burst switched grids. We show that path switching and network-aware resource selection can reduce burst loss probability and average completion time of grid jobs compared to the algorithms that are separately selecting paths and grid resources. In addition to joint resource and path selection, we present an adaptive offset algorithm for grid bursts which minimizes the average completion time. We show that the adaptive offset based QoS mechanism significantly reduces the job completion times by exploiting the trade-off between decreasing loss probability and increasing delay as a result of the extra offset time.},
