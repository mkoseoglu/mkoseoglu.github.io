 abstract = {Throughput model for non-persistent CSMA networks which was proposed by Kleinrock and Tobagi has been widely used, although it provides a loose lower bound when nodes are distributed in a large area because the analysis assumes that the propagation delay between each pair of users equals to the largest propagation delay in the network. We present a throughput analysis which considers the spatial distribution of nodes. We obtain a simple throughput expression which predicts throughput with an 8% maximum error whereas the earlier model results in a 44% error when the maximum propagation delay equals to the packet transmission time.},
